title: What is JSON Schema?
---
JSON Schema is a declarative language for annotating and validating JSON documents' structure, constraints, and data types. It provides a way to standardize and define expectations for JSON data.

## Benefits of JSON Schema
### For Developers
JSON Schema enables developers to:


* **Describe existing data formats**: JSON Schema allows you to describe your existing JSON data formats' structure, constraints, and data types.
* **Define rules and constraints**: When your JSON documents adhere to these constraints, It becomes easier to exchange structured data between applications because it follows a consistent pattern.
* **Clear documentation**: JSON Schema supports the creation of documentation that is easily understandable by humans and machines.
* **Highly extensible:** JSON Schema can be tailored to fit your needs. You can also create custom keywords, formats, and validation rules to suit your requirements.
* **Validates Data: JSON Schema validates data** in the following ways:
    * **Automated testing**: JSON Schema validation enables automated testing, ensuring data consistently adheres to the specified rules and constraints.
    * **Enhance data quality**: JSON Schema helps ensure the quality of client-submitted data by enforcing validation rules and preventing inconsistencies, errors, and malicious inputs.
* **Wide range of tools available**: The JSON Schema community offers a wealth of tools and resources across many programming languages to help you create, validate, and integrate your schemas.

### For Organizations

JSON Schema enables organizations to:



* **Streamline testing and validation**: JSON Schema simplifies your validation logic to reduce your codeâ€™s complexity and save time on development. It also defines constraints for your data structures to catch and prevent errors, inconsistencies, and invalid data.
* **Exchange data seamlessly**: JSON Schema establishes a common language for data exchange, no matter the complexity of your project. It defines precise validation rules for your data structures to create a shared understanding and increase interoperability across different systems and platforms.
* **Document your data**: Create a clear, standardized representation of your data to improve understanding and collaboration among developers, stakeholders, and collaborators.
* **Vibrant tooling ecosystem**: JSON Schema supports various languages, libraries, and frameworks with community-driven tools.

## History of JSON Schema 


JSON Schema dates back to the [first JSON Schema proposal](https://web.archive.org/web/20071026185150/http://json.com/json-schema-proposal/) submitted by Kris Zyp to [json.com](http://json.com) on October 2nd, 2007.

The current version of JSON Schema is [2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/release-notes), which represents the latest advancements and has expanded capabilities compared with the previous versions, `draft-04`, `draft-06`, and `draft-07`.

We recommend using the newest version of JSON Schema and taking advantage of its benefits.
